                                  It's a time of uncertainty. Unrest ripples through the campus community as department directors battle budgetary challenges which are forcing them to reevaluate service offerings and consider changes to processes put in place long ago. Front facing services like computer labs and printing which have historically been viewed as integral parts of the student learning experience and statisfaction have managed to remain largely unchanged...until now.

                                  The long standing quota system which gave students a weekly alotment of 280 pages has drawn critism from students and staff alike. A few rebillious staff members from across IT are working together and with various community groups and the Student Government to discuss the future of printing.

                        The idea for this presentation started back in December when I was asked to analyze some printer usage stats following a change to the quota policy
                        that reduced the amount of quota given, but allocated it all in a lump sum.

                        <img src="images/pharos-report-sample.png" />

                        <p>
                            The pharos reports, provide a good base level, but they are very static, and require a sys admin to go in and run them. They are also very data heavy and not visual.

                        <p>
                            I already had some familiarity with the Pharos Database, having done some basic analysis on who was using and how much they were using quota.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So I gave myself a few days to reacquiant myself, update some previously written scripts and get to work analyzing the data.

                            This proved to be a blackhole, I was hooked, the more queries I wrote, the more I wanted to write.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        <p>
                            After that week was over, I had successfully reversed engineered most of the high level reports, and got the data into excel so I could begin modeling it, the end result was a short executive report outlining the minor decline in printing over the same period the previous year.
